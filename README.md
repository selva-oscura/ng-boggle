# NgBoggle

Boggle -- basic Angular web application for generating Boggle game boards. 

(No patent infringement intended and no intent to divert funds from the game's owners. It just seemed like a fun programming challenge and a way to play virtually with family members at a time when Covid-19-related lockdowns are preventing IRL visits.)

This project was bootstrapped using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.5.
